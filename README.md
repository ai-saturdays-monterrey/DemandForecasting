# Demand Forecasting
Comparative study of demand forecasting methods based on the Kaggle competition Store Item Demand Forecasting (https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only).

This was done as part of the activities of the Monterrey chapter of the AI Saturdays initiative (https://nurture.ai/ai-saturdays) and the fastAI course (http://www.fast.ai/)

We considered three approaches: XBoost, Deep learning, and ARIMA.
